## On variable fonts

In 2016 Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, and Google announced Version 1.8 of the OpenType font format which introduced variable fonts - a format in which the equivalent of multiple individual fonts can be packaged within a single font file. In this talk, we will look at what variable fonts are and how we can use them in our work today.

## Demystifying 'this' in JavaScript.

Ever tried calling 'this' in JavaScript and got something totally different than what you expected (or even nothing at all!)? Or have you wondered why you need to add 'this.clickHandler = this.clickHandler.bind(this)' in your constructor when using the ES6 class syntax or a library like React?

Join Schalk and Dani as they pull back the curtain on this (see what we did there) seemingly arcane, chaotic and unpredictable JavaScript functionality, to expose the straightforward logic that underlies it.
